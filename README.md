# ComicMischief
This is my first Go project.

I have used variables and types in the Go programming language to maintain the catalog of items in my comic book store Comic Mischief.

I would be very happy to listen to your suggestions and advice. Check it out!

You can also star the repository if you like it! ðŸŒŸ
